# KeyforgeSync

A script to sync keyforge decks from the Master Vault to other community services.

**_USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK_**

Seriously. I make no promises that any one of these sites won't shut down your account, ban you, or any other type of stuff.

## Usage

- Clone the repo
- `npm i`
- Fill in the fields from example.dat and rename to creds.dat
- If you want to disable sync to Crucible or Decks of Keyforge you can do so by change the flags in the app.ts file to false.
- `npm run sync`

## TODO

- [ ] Automate credential setup
- [ ] Multiuser
- [ ] Sync only hearted decks
- [ ] GUI?
